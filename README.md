# Line-coding-encoder
Implementation of Line coding schemes with digital data generator
The code contains the following functions: LCS, Longest Palindrome, 4 & 8 consecutive zeroes function and a random binary generation function and implements line coding schemes such as NRZ-L, NRZ-I, Manchester, and Differential Manchester on the randomly generated binary data stream.

Digital data generator: generates completely random data sequence and a random sequence with some fixed sub-sequences like eight or four consecutive zeros.


#### Steps
1. Run the program.
2. Choose the method of generating a data stream and enter a specific subsequence if prompted. 
3. choose the line-encoding scheme.

In the output you will a binary data of selected encoding scheme which is represented in NRZ-L. Incase you selected the NRZ-L encoding scheme in step 3 , then the binary generated is in NRZ-L no other binary data will be displayed.

For example :
The random data generated is 010000100111011110110000110

Method selected : NRZ-I
Then in output we get 100000111010010100100000100

So the NRZ-I graphical representation of binary data 010000100111011110110000110  is
